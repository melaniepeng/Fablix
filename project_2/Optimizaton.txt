1. We used Sax parser to optimize the run time for xml parsing. Even though Dom is a great technology, we still think that it would be better to use SAX on the larger xml file due to its function and characteristics. We found out that SAX is much faster than DOM, so to make sure that we can set our time into 15 min, we choose to use SAX as one of our optimization.
2. We also optimize our inserting procedure. We believe that it would be too slow if we go to the database and search each data one by one, so we decide to first get the database and put the data from the database into the Array of in a Map. By doing this way, we can simply compare our data during the for loop.
